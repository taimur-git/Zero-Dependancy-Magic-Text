# Zero Dependancy Magic Text
(0DMT for short.) 

0DMT's goal is to be able to:
 - create typing animations
 - create deleting typing animations
 - create text rotation animations
 - create jumble-unjumble animations
 - create a lot more, hopefully.

All while being easy to use and implement the aforementioned text animations (hence the magic text) and having no other libraries attached (hence the zero dependancy). 0DMT is being written in TypeScript. More documentation will come as soon as it is finished.
